## What Kind of Life Do I Expect?

Life, a word that sounds simple yet carries the dreams and expectations of countless people. Everyone has an ideal picture of life in their heart—perhaps it’s the skyscrapers in a bustling metropolis, or perhaps it’s the pastoral scenery in a quiet countryside. But the life I yearn for is in a small county town, spending ordinary yet warm days with you.

Life in a small county town is always slow-paced, without the noise and rush of a big city. A taxi ride costs just seven yuan, and a bowl of noodles for nine yuan can fill you with satisfaction. Houses here are affordable; five or six hundred thousand yuan can buy a cozy home, and a car costs just seventy or eighty thousand yuan, enough for daily commuting. There’s no rush hour traffic, and the streets are always quiet and orderly. Yet the night market is lively, with bright lights and bustling crowds, full of the warmth of everyday life. This kind of life is simple yet warm, ordinary yet filled with happiness.

The life I expect doesn’t require much material wealth or social status. I just want to be with you, spending every ordinary day together. Waking up in the morning, sunlight filters through the curtains, and you’re by my side, smiling and saying good morning. We have breakfast together, chat about the day’s plans, and then head off to work. After work, we stroll through the night market, enjoying a bowl of steaming noodles or buying some snacks to take home. In the evening, we sit on the sofa, watching TV, chatting, and savoring the moments that belong to us.

This kind of life may sound mundane, but to me, it’s the most genuine happiness. I don’t need much luxury or excitement. I just want to be with you, spending every ordinary day together. This kind of life, though simple, is filled with love and warmth.

However, this kind of life feels like a distant dream to me. I don’t even dare to think about it because I know it’s not easy to achieve. Especially in this society, the pressure on men is always greater than on women. If a woman says she wants to get married in a small county town and live a simple life, people might think she’s down-to-earth and genuine. But if a man says the same thing, he’d likely be looked down upon. People might think he lacks ambition, drive, or even capability.

But honestly, I don’t think there’s anything wrong with this kind of life. Everyone has their own way of living. Some prefer the hustle and bustle of big cities, while others enjoy the tranquility of small towns. As for me, I just want a simple and warm life, spending every ordinary day with you.

Perhaps this kind of life doesn’t align with societal expectations or most people’s values. But I believe life is personal, and there’s no need to change your dreams to fit others’ standards. Everyone has their own path—some chase fame and fortune, while others find joy in simplicity. For me, I just want a simple and warm life, spending every ordinary day with you.

Of course, I also know that this kind of life isn’t easy to achieve. Especially in this society, men face greater pressure. We need to work hard, earn money to support our families, and shoulder responsibilities. We can’t just dream of a simple life; we also need to have aspirations and goals. But truly, I don’t think there’s anything wrong with this kind of life. Everyone has their own way of living. Some prefer the hustle and bustle of big cities, while others enjoy the tranquility of small towns. As for me, I just want a simple and warm life, spending every ordinary day with you.

Perhaps this kind of life doesn’t align with societal expectations or most people’s values. But I believe life is personal, and there’s no need to change your dreams to fit others’ standards. Everyone has their own path—some chase fame and fortune, while others find joy in simplicity. For me, I just want a simple and warm life, spending every ordinary day with you.

In the end, the life I expect is in a small county town, spending ordinary yet warm days with you. It doesn’t require much material wealth or social status. I just want to be with you, spending every ordinary day together. This kind of life, though simple, is filled with love and warmth. This kind of life, though ordinary, is the truest happiness in my heart.

Perhaps this kind of life isn’t easy to achieve, but I believe that as long as we work hard together, one day we’ll live this life. Being with you, spending every ordinary day together—that’s the life I expect.
