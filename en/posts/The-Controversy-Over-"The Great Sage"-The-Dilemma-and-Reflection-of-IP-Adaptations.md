## The Controversy Over "The Great Sage": The Dilemma and Reflection of IP Adaptations

Recently, Tencent Video's release of _The Great Sage_ has sparked widespread controversy. This drama, adapted from the novel of the same name by _Mai Bao Xiao Lang Jun_, has faced strong dissatisfaction from fans of the original work. The adaptation has drastically altered the story, shifting from a male-oriented fantasy to a costume detective drama, and replacing monster-fighting and leveling-up elements with romantic daily life. These changes have gone beyond reasonable adaptation, turning into a "radical reimagining" of the original work.

### From Fantasy to Detective Drama: A Complete Overhaul of the Core Setting

The drama has almost entirely removed the fantasy elements of the original work, replacing them with the tropes of a costume detective drama. The protagonist has been transformed from a cultivator into a detective, and the world-building has shifted from a fantasy continent to an ordinary ancient society. This kind of adaptation completely changes the core setting of the work. The producers may believe that such changes better cater to mainstream tastes, but they have overlooked the emotional needs of the original fans. This adaptation not only disrespects the original work but also underestimates the intelligence of the audience.

### The "Radical Change" Trap in IP Adaptations

In recent years, IP adaptations have frequently fallen into the trap of "radical changes." _Joy of Life 2_ faces similar issues, with criticisms over monotonous scenes, lack of extras, and watered-down plots. These phenomena reflect the producers' eagerness for quick profits in IP adaptations: they focus more on how to monetize quickly rather than how to faithfully present the essence of the original work. This creative attitude has led to a large number of adaptations losing the soul of the original work, becoming mediocre productions.

### Declining Tolerance for "Radical Changes"

From market feedback, it is clear that audiences' tolerance for "radical changes" is decreasing. The Douban rating for _The Great Sage_ continues to drop, with the comment section filled with disappointment from original fans. This phenomenon deserves deep reflection from producers: IP adaptation is not simply about commercial monetization but requires finding a balance between respecting the original work and innovating in expression. Successful adaptations should retain the essence of the original work while making appropriate adjustments for the screen.

### The Conflict Between Creative Philosophy and Market Demand

The current dilemma faced by IP adaptations is essentially a conflict between creative philosophy and market demand. Producers need to recognize that original fans are the foundation of IP adaptations, and ignoring their demands is akin to self-sabotage. Only by truly understanding the spirit of the original work and maintaining a sense of reverence during adaptation can they create works that are both critically acclaimed and commercially successful. This is not just a business consideration but also a basic respect for literary creation.

### Conclusion

The controversy over the radical changes in _The Great Sage_ once again reminds us of the complexity and challenges of IP adaptations. While pursuing commercial interests, producers must respect the spirit of the original work and listen to the voices of fans. Only by finding a balance between respect and innovation can they create truly moving works. It is hoped that future IP adaptations can learn from this and break free from the trap of "radical changes," ushering in healthier development.
