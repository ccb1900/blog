Many people still don't believe it, making excuses for their laziness.

The emergence of DeepSeek around Chinese New Year has fully validated that old saying.

Those with strong execution power have already started quietly making big money.

A friend of mine was laid off before the Spring Festival. Restless at home, he was always thinking about how to make money. He tried driving for Didi and delivering food, but after a month of hard work, he only earned around 4,000 yuan. What's worse, there was no room for growth—it was just physical labor, wasting his master's degree from a top-tier university (211).

I suggested he try doing content creation, and without hesitation, he jumped right in.

He studied civil engineering in university, which is now known as one of the "bottomless pits" of majors. But he had one huge advantage: strong execution power. Whatever could make money, he believed in and dared to try.

When we caught up after the Spring Festival, he told me that in just one month, he had already made 936.5 yuan through content creation.

In the internet age, execution power is the biggest difference between people.

When ChatGPT first came out, many people recognized the earning potential of AI. But most ordinary people just joined in the fun without actually using it to make money—they didn't know how, and just tried some mindless chatting.

Now DeepSeek has once again demonstrated the power of AI—and this time, it's from an unknown domestic startup company. All you need to do is ask high-quality questions, and it will give you high-quality answers. Plus, it even shows the deep thinking process behind them—and this is just the first generation!

It's hard to imagine what more mature versions of DeepSeek will be capable of, potentially changing the entire game of the internet.

In the AI era, many skills are "idiot-proof"—you just follow the steps and you can make money, getting results you never imagined.

Some people are already using DeepSeek to write copy and make money. There are also more advanced uses: combining DeepSeek with Jieming to easily create high-quality original videos; pairing it with Kimi to automatically generate outlines and excellent PPTs.

Nowadays, many smart people are using AI software to write web novels, create videos, and do all kinds of creative work—earning more on their Media platforms than they ever did working a regular job.

As Charles Dickens said in _A Tale of Two Cities_: "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times."

Many people are still stuck in dead-end jobs, complaining about being born at the wrong time and missing out on the benefits of the era. But every era has its opportunities—you just don't see them or know how to use them.

Even in the 90s when people went into business, they didn't realize it was a golden age for entrepreneurship. It took ten years for them to look back and realize what the opportunities were.

The common trait among successful people in every era is that they dare to think and act.

If you're willing to believe and have strong execution power, you can make money. If you catch the trend, you can achieve financial freedom and social mobility.

The regrettable thing is that many people are still waiting and haven't even realized the tremendous power of AI yet. The tuyere has arrived—it's just that many people don't believe it.

Most people's thinking is still stuck in the old mindset of working a regular job. They remain skeptical and dismissive of unconventional ways to make money.

People who focus solely on their jobs will regret it deeply in three years, not ten. Everyone loves money and wants to make it. But very few people really put their heart into it.

Even when given powerful tools, only a few take action. The methods and processes for making money are all publicly available—there's no secret. The real secret is just to start doing it, learning as you go, gaining insights through action, and continuously improving through trial and error.

Don't haggle over terms or ask how you can make money—the more questions you ask, the weaker your execution power is. Those who just dive in without hesitation are already experiencing the joy of earning money.

People with strong execution power rarely complain because they always find surprises in their actions. Execution power is the essential requirement for making money—and its value will only continue to rise.
